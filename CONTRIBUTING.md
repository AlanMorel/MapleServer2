## State of the project
This project is only at the beginning stages, but we are willing to keep accepting new people that can help.


# Guidelines
In order to contribute, we establish some guidelines to keep the code organized and simple.


## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.


## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). 
We actively welcome your pull requests:
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master` and Do the changes in your fork.
2. Your pull request should be as concice as possible, focusing on as few related things as possible (for example: one PR per bug fix). 
3. Your commit messages should be clear and descriptive (for example: "Fixed bug XY", "Added feature YZ", "Fixed suggestion: using class instead of var").
4. The PR should be based on a resonably recent fork of the `master` branch.
5. Issue that pull request!


## Before opening a PR, follow every step
1. Make sure you code follows the [C# Standards](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions)
2. Use 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
3. Instead of `var player`, use `Player player`
4. In Visual Studio you can `CTRL+K` then `CTRL+D` for formatting
5. Add a blank line in between all methods
6. Check that all new methods and variables and class names are named appropriately
7. Review all your code, line by line
8. Review all your code, line by line, again
9. Open your PR

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/AlanMorel/MapleServer2/issues).
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. 
Report a bug by opening a new issue but make sure to follow this:
- **Before filing an issue** &mdash; use the search function to see if a similar issue might exist already.
- **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the latest `master` branch in the repository.

Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? 
What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help people to fix any potential bugs.


### Any contributions made will be open-source with this project
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be open-source.
